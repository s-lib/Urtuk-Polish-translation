Each class can hold up to 4 mutators. There are #h{2 types} of mutators. ~ The first type is for traits. ~ The second type is for Focus abilities (which overwrite the class Focus ability). ~ Extraction of traits is paid for with a resource called #h-gold{Life Essence}, which is earned after each successful battle. ~ The more powerful the trait, the more costly it is to extract. Some traits will cost more than what can be earned in one battle, but you can save Life Essence for future extractions. ~ Life Essence can be found in your resource pool, and can also be used during special missions.",

This applies either with #h{Aegis} or #h{shielding} from an ally. ~ - If an enemy is flanked by your characters on opposing hexes, a successful attack will result in a #h{Backstab}, which incurs #h{critical} (+50%) damage! ~ - If a character's hex is a different elevation than the attacker's, a damage bonus or penalty of 20% applies.~ ~ Some effects can trigger additional behavior or other effects. ~ - If a character is pushed or bashed into an allied unit, that ally will automatically retaliate with a free attack. Retaliation applies only against melee attackers, and only when the ally is not stunned. ~ - If a character is #h{Engaged} and moves away from an 'Engaging enemy', that enemy will automatically get a free attack (attack of opportunity). ~ - Any hit against #h{slowed} or #h{stunned} characters will incur #h{critical} damage.~ ~Additionally, if a character receives a critical hit, other negative effects may be applied to him (based on the attacker's traits).~ ~ - Every ability use costs #h{stamina}. Stamina is refreshed every turn, but if you strike many times in a single turn, it's possible to drain all your stamina. This will result in an #h{out of breath} status and the unit won't be able to execute any abilities (attack, shield ally, ranged support, etc.) until the following turn.",

A broken armour won't regenerate! ~ Every piece of armour has a protection value, and when #h-red{less than 50%} is left, it will slowly #h-red{flicker} red. When at #h-red{zero}, i.e. when armour is #h-red{broken}, the #h-red{flickering} is doubled. ~ The armour's protection #h{regenerates} at 25% rate per turn.",
